# RHI Internal requests

This repository serves as the starting point for internal requests to the RHI technology team.

RHI employees are encouraged to enter any software related request or initiative as an issue.  The tech team will pick it from there and will work with the originator to ensure proper requirements are specified and a priority can be assigned.
